# kiss.io # v1.4.6

kiss.io is my side project, dedicated for creating a better interface and functionality for the great ole' socket.io v1.4.6 real-time framework, following and honoring the KISS principle - **Keep it Simple, Stupid!**

**Note about versions:** kiss.io version will always be correspondent and synced with the latest socket.io version. Meaning that every change that will be made in the main socket.io repository, will be incorporated into kiss.io accordingly, and supply backwards API compatibility to older versions of kiss.io (**and kiss.io only**).
